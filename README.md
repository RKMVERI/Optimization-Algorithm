# Optimization-Algorithm
For learning OPTAL

Here All optimization techniques are explained through code. You can find the codes inside the ipynb files along with some explaination. The codes are very simple to understand, if the theory is clear to you.
Also I think, it will be greatful if anyone want to help me by just making the ipynb files more understable by seperation the topics.
